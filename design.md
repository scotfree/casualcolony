# Casual Colony — Design

Working design document. Expect this to change; it's a thinking surface, not a spec.

## Vision

A casual colony re-builder. The map is a grid of buildings representing a dead
city. The player spends **energy** to activate buildings, subject to
constraints. An activated building does something useful — houses workers,
produces food, generates more energy, or activates its neighbours — which in
turn lets the player activate more buildings.

The feel is a puzzle, not a simulation. There is no real-time pressure and no
resource ticking while you think. A turn is a decision: *which building do I
activate next, and what does that unlock?* A level is a search for a good
activation sequence. You win by bringing enough of the map under control before
you run out of energy.

## Core loop

1. Look at the board and the energy remaining.
2. Choose a building to activate and pay its energy cost.
3. That activation cascades — neighbours light up, resources are produced,
   new options open.
4. Repeat until you exceed the control threshold (win) or can no longer afford
   any useful activation (lose).

The interesting decisions come from cascades. Activating the *right* building
sets off a chain that pays for itself several times over; activating the wrong
one strands a cluster and wastes energy. Ordering matters more than raw
resource count.

## Concepts

### The map

A 2D grid. Every cell holds exactly one building. There are no empty cells —
"empty" is represented by an inert building type (rubble, desert, ruins).

Grid size should suit a phone held in portrait: taller than it is wide, and
large enough that a cascade feels like it travels somewhere. Currently 10×14,
fixed per level so that every player sees the same puzzle.

Adjacency is **orthogonal only** — no diagonals. See the percolation note under
Milestone 1; this choice is load-bearing, not cosmetic.

### Levels are files, not randomness

Levels are authored JSON, loaded at runtime. The game contains no random number
generation at all: any randomness happens once, at authoring time, and the
result is baked into a file. The same level always plays the same way.

The format uses row strings and a legend so a level can be read and edited in a
text editor:

```json
{
  "name": "Random Crystal Forest",
  "size": { "width": 10, "height": 14 },
  "legend": { ".": "desert", "C": "crystal" },
  "grid": ["..C..CC..C", "CC.CCC.CCC"]
}
```

A legend entry maps one character to one building type id. Adding a building
type means one entry in the building table and one legend character — nothing
else.

### Buildings

A building **type** is data, not code branching. Each type has:

- `id` — internal key
- `name` — display name
- `icon` — glyph or sprite
- `activate(cell, world)` — what happens when it becomes active
- cost, and any constraints on whether it *may* be activated

Adding a building type should mean adding one entry to a table. If it means
editing a switch statement in three files, the model is wrong.

### Energy

The player's single spendable currency, and the source of all pressure. Every
activation costs energy. Some buildings return more energy than they cost —
those are the engine of a run, and finding them is the puzzle.

A level starts with a fixed energy budget. Running out with the control
threshold unmet is the loss condition.

### Activation and cascades

Buildings are **inactive** or **active**. Activation is currently permanent —
once lit, a building stays lit. (Decay, upkeep, or deactivation are possible
later, but they turn a puzzle into a simulation, so not now.)

Activation propagates. A building's `activate` may activate others, which may
activate others in turn. This is a graph traversal from the clicked cell, and
it is where the game's character lives.

### Control

Win condition: fraction of the map activated exceeds some threshold. Exactly
how "control" is measured — raw active count, contiguous territory, weighted by
building value — is open.

## Building taxonomy (sketch)

Not committed to, just mapping the space:

| Role | Does | Tension it creates |
|---|---|---|
| **Inert** | Nothing. Occupies space, blocks propagation. | Shapes the board topology |
| **Conductor** | Activates neighbours | The cascade engine |
| **Power** | Refunds or generates energy | Extends the run |
| **Housing** | Provides workers | Gates other buildings |
| **Farm** | Produces food | Upkeep for workers |
| **Infrastructure** | Extends activation range, bridges gaps | Connects stranded clusters |

The general shape: conductors spread, power sustains, housing and farms gate
each other, infrastructure fixes topology problems. Most types should both give
something and demand something.

## Milestone 1 — Crystals and Desert

Deliberately minimal: the smallest thing that produces a real cascade, so we
can validate the board, input, rendering and deploy pipeline before layering on
mechanics.

**Two types:**

- **Desert** — inert. Does nothing. Blocks propagation.
- **Crystal** — when activated, activates every adjacent crystal.

**Setup:** each cell is a crystal with probability ~0.5, otherwise desert.

**Interaction:** tap a crystal. It activates, and the activation floods through
its connected group of crystals. Active crystals are highlighted.

**No energy, no win condition yet** — this milestone is about making the
cascade feel good.

### The ripple

A cascade is a breadth-first walk from the tapped cell. The BFS *depth* is what
makes it feel good: rather than lighting the whole group at once, each cell is
stamped with `activateAt = now + depth × RIPPLE_STEP` and lights when the clock
reaches it. Rendering just compares against the clock — no timers, no animation
queue, and the activation visibly travels outward from the player's finger.

This also means a cascade is scheduled entirely at tap time. The traversal is a
pure function of the board (`computeCascade`), which keeps it testable.

### Why 50% is the right number

Tapping a crystal activates its entire connected component, so cluster size
distribution *is* the game feel. That distribution is governed by site
percolation on a square lattice, and it changes sharply around a critical
density:

- **4-neighbour** (orthogonal) adjacency: critical density ≈ **0.593**
- **8-neighbour** (incl. diagonals) adjacency: critical density ≈ **0.407**

Below critical, clusters are finite and mostly small — tapping lights up a
satisfying local patch and stops. Above it, a single cluster spans the whole
board — one tap lights nearly everything and there is no game.

At the proposed 50%, these two adjacency rules land on **opposite sides** of
their thresholds. With 4-neighbour adjacency, 0.5 sits comfortably below 0.593:
mostly modest clusters, occasional big satisfying one. With 8-neighbour, 0.5 is
well above 0.407 and the board will tend to light up in a single tap.

So the intuition that 50% gives "a few neighbours, then an isolated cluster" is
right — but specifically for orthogonal adjacency. Density and adjacency have
to be chosen together, and density is the main dial for tuning cascade size
later.

## Decisions so far

| Decision | Why |
|---|---|
| Orthogonal adjacency | Keeps 50% density below the percolation threshold, so clusters stay finite |
| Levels as JSON files, no runtime RNG | Reproducible boards; levels become authorable content |
| Fixed grid, letterboxed square cells | Every player sees the same puzzle; a grid with non-square cells looks wrong |
| Ripple via BFS depth + timestamps | Cascade feel, with no timers and a pure, testable traversal |
| Sandbox before energy | Get the cascade feeling right before adding pressure |

## Open questions

- How is control measured — active cell count, or something spatial?
- Do buildings ever deactivate?
- Are levels hand-authored, or generated offline and then curated?
- Does the player ever *place* buildings, or only activate what's there?
- Where does energy come from at the start of a level — fixed budget, or seeded
  by a starting building?

## Explicitly not doing yet

- Real-time ticking of any kind
- Save/load or progression between levels
- Sound
- Building placement or construction
